This is a SEQ 200MHz (8k channels) project.  Only one IF.  

One source, Per-emb-2, observed in 17 obsnums.

Oddly enough , beam13 looks ok, at 90GHz.

90.978989 = HC3N

Narrow window, dv=5 dw=20 look ok, with low order b_order=1.  For some obsnums beam 3 seems still
somewhat varying and may need to be masked out, but overall the signal is fairly strong.

PV-slices show strong stripes, which is no good, so may need extra work depending on what PI wants.
